Simple proof-of-concept for a simulated multinode searchable database recommendation system

To run the simulator, execute "python Framework.py" in the directory with all the project files

To run the recommender, execute "python Recommender.py <data file name> <seed item number>" in the directory with the recommender file and testdata.py

Data file is a tab delimited two column text file of item number and course name. See testdata.dat for an example

Each problem is currently limited to one tag and search matches query string against problem tags

Not all functions are implemented. Type 'help' for a full listing and status of each command
